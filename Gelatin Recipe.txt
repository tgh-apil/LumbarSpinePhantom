Gelatin Recipe for neuraxial phantom


Ingredients
-------------------------------------------------------
Knox Gelatine Powder 100g
Water 1L
Psyllium Fiber 2 heaping teaspoon fulls (~8-12 g)

Each model takes about 450 ml. Gelatine powder density is pretty close to 1 so 10:1 volume ratio works.

Soak gelatin in cold water until the ganules have absorbed the water and thickened. 
Heat until granules melt, then bring to a boil and keep at boil for about 4 minutes. This is only necessary if you want to increase the shelf-life of the Gelatin, otherwise just heating to a bit above melting point is fine. Should dissolve quite easily with minimal mixing. 
Cool then refridgerate until well set (at least 2-3 hours).
Melt the gelatin but try to keep the temperature below 40C.
Cool then refridgerate until well set (at least 2-3 hours).
Repeat melt-cool cycles to increase strength. Typically 3 cycles (3 setting periods).
When ready to pour in models, ensure temperature is below 40. Mix metamucil thouroughly in a cup with about a ladle full of the gelatine, then pour the mixture into the gelatin and mix well. If the mixture has a lot of granules then pour in mold through a strainer.

Keep covered during setting to minimize contamination with bacteria/yeast.

Store in refrigerator when not in use. After gelatin is set keep covered with Saran wrap to minimize moisture loss in the fridge.
